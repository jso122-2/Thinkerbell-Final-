The Brief Overview:
Pringles AUNZ is an official Movember partner and the charity is celebrating 20 years in Australia, so it’s set to be the biggest fundraiser yet. Pringles and Movember have joined forces to drive more open conversations around men’s mental health, encouraging Aussies to check in on friends’ mental wellbeing and talk when times are tough.
To kick off the partnership, Pringles is hosting a shave down event at the Woolworths offices in Sydney on 31 October (approximate time 11AM), raising vital funds and awareness this Movember. At the event, Pringles employees and Talent will ‘shave down’ to start Movember with a completely clean shaven face.
Pringles will invite TV/radio/news outlets down to capture the event. As the Pringles spokesperson, Talent will touch on their lived experience (focussing on men’s mental health) and commitment to fundraising for Movember. A thorough briefing document will be shared in advance with all key messaging and Pringles will arrange a briefing call with the Talent to align before the event.
As part of this collaboration, Pringles is looking for the Talent to create two pieces of social content to be shared across their own Instagram channel. Captured in his own unique tone of voice and style, content needs to showcase the shave down event and/or lived experience of mental health.

The Brief Overview:
Barilla is a family business, founded in Parma in 1877. Today, it is renowned in Italy and around the world for the excellence of its food products advocating tasty, hearty, and wholesome nutrition, inspired by the Mediterranean Diet and the Italian lifestyle. The company’s commitment is to offer people the joy that good, well-made food can bring them, produced with selected ingredients from responsible supply chains, to contribute to a better present and future. Overall, Barilla’s brand role is to elevate the everyday through surprising acts of love for life, always with a touch of Italian inventiveness. Barilla wants to spread a new way of enjoying pasta, calling it “a sign of love”. 
In honor of Valentine’s Day, Barilla is thrilled to launch its heartwarming ‘Pasta Love’ campaign that encourages people to express their love in a unique way: by cooking pasta for their loved ones. This campaign seeks to shift the focus from traditional gifts to the art of creating a love-filled pasta meal, making the act of cooking a plate of pasta a powerful gesture of love and care. The goals of the campaign are to position Barilla pasta as a symbol of love, increase brand visibility and awareness. 
As part of this collaboration, Barilla is looking for the Talent to create seven pieces of social content to be shared across their own Instagram and TikTok channels. Captured in their own unique tone of voice and style, content needs to showcase the Barilla brand and Barilla’s products.
